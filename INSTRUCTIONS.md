After cloning the repo, please run the app as follows (I like using yarn):

- yarn
- yarn dev

This will install dependencies and run the app on the local server

If for some reason you prefer using npm:

- npm install
- npm run start

shall do the job.

I am a big fan of unit tests, but I find it redundant for the scope of this task given that it should take ~2hours to be done

Thanks for your time!
